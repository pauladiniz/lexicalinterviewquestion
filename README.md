# lexicalinterviewquestion

This is basically a question from a interview where I fucked up everything just because I had no idea how to solve a simple piece of Javascript code.

## sum(a)(b) = a+b

sum(a)(b) = a + b 
sum(a => b => a + b) 

I lost 20 minutes thinking about two lines of code, right now I'm feeling the worst developer but there you go. I'll even edit this on github, my git skills are gone cause I suck right now.
